Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) BY MY COMMITTEE.    This contract was over invoiced to the tune of us$ 215 Million Dollars.    This was done delibrately.    The over - invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.    We not want to transfer this money, which is in a suspense account with the PTF into any oversea account, which we expect you to provide for us.    60 % of the money would be for my partners and I, 30 % of the money would be yours.    For providing us with logistics, which, would include a safe bank account, where we shall facilitate funds transfer into, as soon as documentations are concluded over here 10 % of the money has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the course of the transaction, (both local and international expenses).    If interested in assisting us, please contact me via my secured satellite tel number- 881-631-410-574, specially procured for this project, using the text message.

The deal was concluded and all covering documents, forwarded to Mr Miller to authenticate the claims.    Once the funds were transferred, Mr Miller presented to his bank, all the legal documents and remitted the whole funds to another bank account, and disappeared completely.

I am Dr Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde.    He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979.    He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989.    He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved.    His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo.    There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time.    He is in good humor, but wants to come home.    In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars.    This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association.    If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth.    I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars.    In order to access the his trust fund we need your assistance.    Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.    Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous.    In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction.    You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.    Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.    I have secretly deposited the sum of $30,000,000 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications.    The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number 009GM.    ALTERNATIVE EMAIL, (patrickdan@rediffmail.    om).    Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner.    This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner.    This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously.    My name is DAN PATRICK of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.    Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000) to fight the rebel group.    But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping.    The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col Asheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.    In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.    WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the Europe in your name.    This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.    Our inability to move this money out of Congo all This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office.    Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks.    The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.    Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.    I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response.    NOTE, FOR CONFIDENTIALITY, I WILL ADVISE YOU REPLY ME ON MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL BOX.    As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.    My name is Peter Lawson,a merchant in Dubai, in the UAEI have been diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer which was discovered very late,due to my laxity in carrying for my health.    It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.    I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business.    Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.    But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.    I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.    Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.    I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succour and confort to the less priviledged in our societies, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.    So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the UAE, Algeria and Malaysia.    Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.    I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less priviledged in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves.    Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.    The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars that I have with a Security Company in Europe for safe keeping.    I will want you to help me collect this deposit and disburse it to some charity organizations and to the less priviledged.    Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in this disbursement.    I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.    I am Mr paul agabi, a Lawyer by profession.    I am the personal attorney to Mr Charles (my surname), a national of your country, who used to work with Chevron Oil Exploration Company in Nigeria, herein after shall be referred to as my client.    On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their onlye child were involved in a car accident along Lagos - Ibadan express road.    All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives.    Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives.    This has proved unsuccessful.    I came to know about you through an enquiry I was making in the internet, and I found out you shared the same surname with my client, which is why I have decided to contact you, in order to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank.    Particularly, in a local commercial bank here where the deceased had an account valued at about US$ 15 Million Dollars, has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisticated within the next ten official working days.    Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$15 Million Dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money, on the ratio of 50% for me, and 50% for you.    I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make.    All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this business through.    I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.    Please get in touch with me by email and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about the details of this transaction.    This letter is not intended to to cause any embarrassment but just to contact your esteem self-following the knowledge of your high repute and trustworthiness.    I am Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998.

Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source of upliftment to you also.    You have absolutely nothing to loose in assisting us instead, you have so much to gain.    The then head of state General Sani Abacha, transferred the money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish business man, Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas.    Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills.    Also the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments notes, which I have these information in my custody now.    You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.    Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, about my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.

We have kept just 40% of the entire sum to ourselves for the remaining days because.    I am sick and am writing you from hospital computer because I don't know when I will die.

You might not know anything about me and you obviously are certainly wanting to know why you're reading this e-mail, is it right?    I'm a hacker who opened your email and OStwo months ago.    Never attempt to get in touch with me or find me, it's not possible, because I directed you a letter from YOUR account that I've hacked.    I developed spyware on the adult site and suppose that you enjoyed this site to have a good time (think you understand what I want to say).    Whilst you were watching movies, your browser began operating like a RDP (Remote Control) that have a keylogger which gave me ability to access your monitor and camera.    After that, my software program got all data.    You put passcodes on the web-sites you visited, and I caught them.    Without a doubt, you are able modify each of them, or already modified them.    However it doesn't matter, my app updates it every 5 minutes.    And what did I do?    I compiled a reserve copy of your device of all files and each contact.    I got a dual-screen videofile.    The first section shows the clip you were observing (you have got the perfect taste, haha), the second part displays the video from your web camera.    What actually do you have to do?    Well, in my view, $1000 USD is a good amount of money for our small riddle.    You will do the payment by bitcoins (if you don't recognize this, go searching “how to purchase bitcoin” in Google).    My bitcoin wallet address, 12xDmKxf28FStr6pxVCbv56sPf2nvL3jmT (It is cAsE sensitive, so just copy and paste it).    You have 2 days to make the payment (I put an unique pixel in this email, and from now I know that you have read through this email).    To track the reading of a letter and the actions within it, I use a Facebook pixel, thanks to them (Anything that is applied for the authorities may also help us).    The authorities may also help us.    In case I fail to get bitcoins, I shall undoubtedly send your video files to all your contacts, along with relatives, co-workers, and many more.

Most probably not known then the will you make sure what is there everything is simply simple according to my formula.";
